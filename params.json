{"name":"Vilatac","tagline":"ViLaTaC (Vim LaTeX Table Creator)","body":"# ViLaTaC (Vim LaTeX Table Creator)\r\n\r\neasy table creator for LaTeX, created for vim with the vim-latex plugin.\r\n\r\n# Why?\r\n\r\nLaTeX is nice. Creating tables is horrible. The [perl-latex-table][1] script\r\ndoes not support all the features that I use frequently, e.g. multicolumns,\r\ncmidrules, and so on. With ViLaTaC it is really easy to create tables for print and\r\npublishing.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* minimalistic syntax\r\n* very flexible\r\n* multicolumns\r\n* cmidrules\r\n* individual column formatting\r\n* different font styles for table header and body can be defined in script file\r\n* vim-latex jump marks for captions and labels\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n* set fonts in vilatac\r\n* copy vilatac somewhere to your $PATH, e.g. ~/bin/\r\n* check, that it is executable (chmod +x ~/bin/vilatac)\r\n* put key mapping into ~/.vimrc: cmap TAB !vilatac<CR><C-j>\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nLearning by doing. Try the examples in sample.tex.\r\n\r\n# Other editors\r\nI know, there are other editors. You can use LaTaC with them. The only\r\ndifference is that the jump marks were removed.\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n* latac (it's in this repository)\r\n* [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-latex-table/][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/perl-latex-table/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
