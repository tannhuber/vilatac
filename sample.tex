% Usage:
%    -> Put the following key mapping into ~/.vimrc:
%       cmap TAB !vilatac<CR><C-j>
%    -> Create table (see sample below):
%       1. Use & without whitespace as field
%          separator
%       2. For the midrules between header and body
%          use <startcol>-<endcol>, where <startcol>
%          and <endcol> are the first and last columns
%          to underline
%       3. Use <cellcontent>:<colnumber> for
%          multicolumns, where <colnumber> is the
%          number of columns to combine
%       4. Use line break to start a new line
%    -> Mark table in VISUAL mode
%    -> In normal mode type :TAB to convert table to
%       LaTeX syntax
%    -> Write a caption
%    -> Type <C-j> to jump to alignment field
%    -> Enter <l>, <c> or <r> for left or right
%       alignment of the columns
%    -> Type <C-j> to jump to label field
%    -> Enter label name
